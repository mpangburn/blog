hey.

I'm a software engineering student at [Cal Poly](https://calpoly.edu) on the central coast of California. 

I like healthy technology, syntactic niceties, functions, type systems, and Oxford commas. \\
My favorite programming language right now is [Swift](https://swift.org).

I work part-time as an iOS developer for [Tidepool](https://tidepool.org).[^1]

[^1]: because diabetes sucks.
